# JamCam

## About the app
JamCam is an application that allows you to keep statistics and record replays of a basketball game. Once the game data is complete, a camera is activated to record the key moments of the game. The replays can then be viewed and shared via a communicator. Previous games can be revisited to review statistics and videos. The application also includes a tab for setting the length of a single replay and the situations in which the replay should be recorded (e.g. two-point shot, three-point shot, block). 

JamCam runs on Android devices with Sdk at least 21.

The app was created for mobile applications classes at 3rd year of Compuer Science studies at Pozna≈Ñ University of Technology.
